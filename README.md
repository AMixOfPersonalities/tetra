Tetris, a game with a history spanning over three decades, has seen the collaborative nature of the internet and video game communities giving rise to a wealth of resources. These resources range from tutorials that offer insights into the most efficient piece-stacking strategies to dedicated websites focused on teaching players the art of 'openers' â€“ techniques for arranging the first few tetrominoes for optimal gameplay.

However, the abundance of information can often be confusing to new players who may not yet understand the correct terms or techniques. So inexperienced players oftentimes must struggle through several difficult games of Tetris before achieving success. This led me to produce the idea of creating a program specifically tailored to streamline this learning process.
